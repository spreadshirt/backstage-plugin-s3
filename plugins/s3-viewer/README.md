# @spreadshirt/backstage-plugin-s3-viewer

This plugin creates a new page in Backstage where the user can view the stored elements in AWS S3. This data will be ordered by endpoint and buckets, and using pagination the user will be allowed to check all the stored objects on each bucket, as well as checking the information of the stored elements and download them.

## Introduction

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

With this plugin you will be able to navigate around your internal AWS S3 storage using a table view, as well as previewing and downloading the objects stored there.

## Getting started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Install the plugin by running this command:
    ```bash
    # From your Backstage root directory
    yarn add --cwd packages/app @spreadshirt/backstage-plugin-s3-viewer
    ```

2. Add the new route to the app by adding the following line:
    ```typescript
    // In packages/app/src/App.tsx
    import { S3ViewerPage } from '@spreadshirt/backstage-plugin-s3-viewer';

    const routes = (
      <FlatRoutes>
        {/* ...other routes */}
        <Route path="/s3-viewer" element={<S3ViewerPage />} />
      </FlatRoutes>
    )
    ```

3. Now, add a new element to the Sidebar, so the endpoint can be eassily accessible for the users. You can placce it wherever you prefer:
    ```typescript
    // In packages/app/src/components/Root/Root.tsx
    import { SiAmazons3 } from 'react-icons/si';

    <SidebarPage>
      {/* ...other contents */}
      <SidebarItem icon={SiAmazons3} to="s3-viewer" text="S3 Viewer" />   
    </SidebarPage>
    ```
4. Add the configuration to the `app-config.yaml` file. This is described in the backend plugin.

## Features

- Available endpoints and buckets displayed in a tree view. By clicking them you can select one bucket or another.
- List objects for a bucket using a file explorer style.
- Display information of the selected bucket, as well as for a selected object.
- Preview of the object content (if possible) and possibility to download it.
  - If the object is not an image, it won't be loaded.
  - For performance reasons, only the images with a size below 2MB will be loaded.
- Custom URL generated depending on the selected item, this allows you to share a link to someone else pointing to a concrete endpoint, bucket and even object.
