Cleaned up bucket double clicking issues where it would reset selection to nil, see [#182](https://github.com/spreadshirt/backstage-plugin-s3/issues/182).

Added a bucket visiblity icon to the table display which now implemented a clear bucket feature as double clicking now resets back to root directory of bucket selection.
