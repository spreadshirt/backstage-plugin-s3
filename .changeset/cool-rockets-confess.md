'@spreadshirt/backstage-plugin-s3-viewer-backend': patch
---

Replace some deprecations caused by the removal of the backend-tasks plugin and deprecate old backend system.

The old backend system calls will be completely removed in the next release, so
none of the deprecations caused by these functions are going to be addressed.

More info about this process [in this issue](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/issues/1176).
